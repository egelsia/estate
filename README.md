## _Your Favourite Website to Sell Your Properties!_

It will direct you to the homepage each time you visit the page, where a different property will welcome you. The page where all the properties are served will be redirected to if you click on the Estates tab. You can create a new selling post and POST backend service (Requests can be seen in the console) by clicking the Sell Yours! tab on the menu bar. When creating a new selling post, you must add the image url because there are validations for form inputs. Additionally, requests to "delete" are sent to the backend service.

## Technologies âš¡

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-blue?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat&logo=css3)
The use of CSS improves user experience and makes a website's front end stand out. For styling the project, we have used it.

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-43853D?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white)
Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it highly efficient for handling concurrent requests, enabling faster and scalable web applications with improved performance and resource utilization.

![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bootstrap-blue?style=flat&logo=bootstrap)
It is easy to set up and learn, has a large number of components, a good grid system, styling for many HTML elements, from buttons to typography, and support for JavaScript plugins, increasing its flexibility. It helped us create a responsive layout for our 'Selling Properties' project.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-black?style=flat&logo=javascript)
We utilized JavaScript (JS) to add dynamic behavior and special effects to the Estate Advertisements, enhancing user interaction and improving the webpage's visual appeal.

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-darkblue?style=flat&logo=react)
React provides us with the capability to develop extensive web applications that have the ability to modify data dynamically, all while maintaining a seamless user experience without the need to reload the entire page. 

![React-Router-Dom](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=flat&logo=react-router&logoColor=white)
Our project has many pages or components, and we built it using React Router Dom. However, the page is never refreshed; instead, the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL. React Router Dom makes it possible for this procedure, which is known as routing. This allows us to move around the navbar's links.

**Axios**: Axios is a Javascript library that supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6 and is used to make HTTP requests from node JS or XMLHttpRequests from the browser. It enables client-side XSRF protection and can be used to intercept HTTP requests and responses. Additionally, it can cancel requests. For simpler and easier to manage API calls, we have used Axios.

**Font Montserrat:** Icons play a crucial role in web projects as they serve as visual aids that enhance the understanding and significance of various elements. The integration of Montserrat into our project proved to be immensely beneficial, as it offered a convenient solution for incorporating icons without the need to invest time and effort in creating and managing these graphical assets independently.
