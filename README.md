## _Your Favourite Website to Sell Your Properties!_

Every time you visit the page, it will redirect you to the homepage, where a random property will greet you. If you click on the Estates tab, it will redirect you to the page where all the properties are served. If you click on the Sell Yours! tab, you will go to the page where you can create a new selling post and POST backend service (Requests can be seen in console). There are validations for form inputs you must add the image url in order to create a new selling post. Also "delete" requests are sending to the backend service. 

## Technologies âš¡

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-blue?style=flat&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat&logo=css3)
CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. We have used it for styling the project.

![Bootstrap](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bootstrap-blue?style=flat&logo=bootstrap)
It is easy to set up and master, it has a lot of components, a good grid system, styling for many HTML elements ranging from typography to buttons, as well as support of JavaScript plugins, making it even more flexible. We have used it in order to build our Blog Posts project with a responsive layout.

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-black?style=flat&logo=javascript)
We have used JS in order to add dynamic behavior to the Estate Advertisements and add special effects to the webpage.

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-darkblue?style=flat&logo=react)
React allows us to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page as a single page application.

![React-Router-Dom](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=flat&logo=react-router&logoColor=white)
We have used React Router Dom to build our project that have many pages or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL. This process is called Routing and it is made possible with the help of React Router Dom. In this way, we can navigate between the links in the navbar.

**Axios**: Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node. JS or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP requests and responses and enables client-side protection against XSRF. It also has the ability to cancel requests. We have used Axios for cleaner and easy to manage API calls.

**Font Montserrat:** Icons are important to web projects because they are a visual way to help add meaning to elements. Montserrat allowed us for an easy addition to our project, saving valuable time because we did not need to create and save these graphics ourselves.
